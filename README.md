Notes:

* Run ```install.py``` before running the game, since it installs the necessary libraries.
* The main game is run with ```main.py```.
* Make sure to be in the same directory as ```main.py``` before running the game.
* Run the tutorial and test your environment before playing (options 2 and 3 of the main menu once you run ```main.py```).
* A lot of the game's mechanics are really unintuitive. If you're offered a tutorial, take it! 
* Make sure you're running on at least Python 3.12, 
since this program uses some new features like match-case statements.
* Enjoy!
